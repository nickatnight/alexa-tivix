Alexa-Tivix: Tivix Application for Alexa powered devices
==================================================================


To run, ``fab lambda_push`` in venv to create zip file to upload to AWS lambda.

This application was built with PyPi package: ``pyalexa-skill``

----------------
For some reason, I'm getting errors when I try to upload zip file to AWS lambda
that includes a requirements file with Fabric packages, so for now, I am omitting those.
